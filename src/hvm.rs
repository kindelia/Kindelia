// Welcome to Kindelia's High-order Virtual Machine!
// =================================================
//
// This file is a modification of the project hosted on github.com/kindelia/hvm, and it makes a
// series of changes with the goal of serving the requirements of a peer-to-peer computer.
//
// Kindelia-HVM's memory model
// ---------------------------
// 
// The runtime memory consists of just a vector of u128 pointers. That is:
//
//   Mem ::= Vec<Ptr>
// 
// A pointer has 3 parts:
//
//   Ptr ::= TT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA BBBBBBBBBBBB
//
// Where:
//
//   T : u8  is the pointer tag 
//   A : u72 is the 1st value
//   B : u48 is the 2nd value
//
// There are 12 possible tags:
//
//   Tag | Val | Meaning  
//   ----| --- | -------------------------------
//   DP0 |   0 | a variable, bound to the 1st argument of a duplication
//   DP1 |   1 | a variable, bound to the 2nd argument of a duplication
//   VAR |   2 | a variable, bound to the one argument of a lambda
//   ARG |   3 | an used argument of a lambda or duplication
//   ERA |   4 | an erased argument of a lambda or duplication
//   LAM |   5 | a lambda
//   APP |   6 | an application
//   SUP |   7 | a superposition
//   CTR |   8 | a constructor
//   FUN |   9 | a function
//   OP2 |  10 | a numeric operation
//   NUM |  11 | a 120-bit number
//
// The semantics of the 1st and 2nd values depend on the pointer tag. 
//
//   Tag | 1st ptr value                | 2nd ptr value
//   --- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------
//   DP0 | the duplication label        | points to the duplication node
//   DP1 | the duplication label        | points to the duplication node
//   VAR | not used                     | points to the lambda node
//   ARG | not used                     | points to the variable occurrence
//   ERA | not used                     | not used
//   LAM | not used                     | points to the lambda node
//   APP | not used                     | points to the application node
//   SUP | the duplication label        | points to the superposition node
//   CTR | the constructor name         | points to the constructor node
//   FUN | the function name            | points to the function node
//   OP2 | the operation name           | points to the operation node
//   NUM | the most significant 72 bits | the least significant 48 bits
//
// Notes:
//
//   1. The duplication label is an internal value used on the DUP-SUP rule.
//   2. The operation name only uses 4 of the 72 bits, as there are only 16 ops.
//   3. NUM pointers don't point anywhere, they just store the number directly.
//
// A node is a tuple of N pointers stored on sequential memory indices.
// The meaning of each index depends on the node. There are 7 types:
//
//   Duplication Node:
//   - [0] => either an ERA or an ARG pointing to the 1st variable location
//   - [1] => either an ERA or an ARG pointing to the 2nd variable location
//   - [2] => pointer to the duplicated expression
//
//   Lambda Node:
//   - [0] => either and ERA or an ERA pointing to the variable location
//   - [1] => pointer to the lambda's body
//   
//   Application Node:
//   - [0] => pointer to the lambda
//   - [1] => pointer to the argument
//
//   Superposition Node:
//   - [0] => pointer to the 1st superposed value
//   - [1] => pointer to the 2sd superposed value
//
//   Constructor Node:
//   - [0] => pointer to the 1st field
//   - [1] => pointer to the 2nd field
//   - ... => ...
//   - [N] => pointer to the Nth field
//
//   Function Node:
//   - [0] => pointer to the 1st argument
//   - [1] => pointer to the 2nd argument
//   - ... => ...
//   - [N] => pointer to the Nth argument
//
//   Operation Node:
//   - [0] => pointer to the 1st operand
//   - [1] => pointer to the 2nd operand
//
// Notes:
//
//   1. Duplication nodes DON'T have a body. They "float" on the global scope.
//   2. Lambdas and Duplications point to their variables, and vice-versa.
//   3. ARG pointers can only show up inside Lambdas and Duplications.
//   4. Nums and vars don't require a node type, because they're unboxed.
//   5. Function and Constructor arities depends on the user-provided definition.
//
// Example 0:
// 
//   Term:
//
//    {T2 #7 #8}
//
//   Memory:
//
//     Root : Ptr(CTR, 0x0000000007b9d30a43, 0x000000000000)
//     0x00 | Ptr(NUM, 0x000000000000000000, 0x000000000007) // the tuple's 1st field
//     0x01 | Ptr(NUM, 0x000000000000000000, 0x000000000008) // the tuple's 2nd field
//
//   Notes:
//     
//     1. This is just a pair with two numbers.
//     2. The root pointer is not stored on memory.
//     3. The '0x0000000007b9d30a43' constant encodes the 'T2' name.
//     4. Since nums are unboxed, a 2-tuple uses 2 memory slots, or 32 bytes.
//
// Example 1:
//
//   Term:
//
//     λ~ λb b
//
//   Memory:
//
//     Root : Ptr(LAM, 0x000000000000000000, 0x000000000000)
//     0x00 | Ptr(ERA, 0x000000000000000000, 0x000000000000) // 1st lambda's argument
//     0x01 | Ptr(LAM, 0x000000000000000000, 0x000000000002) // 1st lambda's body
//     0x02 | Ptr(ARG, 0x000000000000000000, 0x000000000003) // 2nd lambda's argument
//     0x03 | Ptr(VAR, 0x000000000000000000, 0x000000000002) // 2nd lambda's body
//
//   Notes:
//
//     1. This is a λ-term that discards the 1st argument and returns the 2nd.
//     2. The 1st lambda's argument not used, thus, an ERA pointer.
//     3. The 2nd lambda's argument points to its variable, and vice-versa.
//     4. Each lambda uses 2 memory slots. This term uses 64 bytes in total.
//     
// Example 2:
//
//   Term:
//     
//     λx dup x0 x1 = x; (* x0 x1)
//
//   Memory:
//
//     Root : Ptr(LAM, 0x000000000000000000, 0x000000000000)
//     0x00 | Ptr(ARG, 0x000000000000000000, 0x000000000004) // the lambda's argument
//     0x01 | Ptr(OP2, 0x000000000000000002, 0x000000000005) // the lambda's body
//     0x02 | Ptr(ARG, 0x000000000000000000, 0x000000000005) // the duplication's 1st argument
//     0x03 | Ptr(ARG, 0x000000000000000000, 0x000000000006) // the duplication's 2nd argument
//     0x04 | Ptr(VAR, 0x000000000000000000, 0x000000000000) // the duplicated expression
//     0x05 | Ptr(DP0, 0x7b93e8d2b9ba31fb21, 0x000000000002) // the operator's 1st operand
//     0x06 | Ptr(DP1, 0x7b93e8d2b9ba31fb21, 0x000000000002) // the operator's 2st operand
//
//   Notes:
//     
//     1. This is a lambda function that squares a number.
//     2. Notice how every ARGs point to a VAR/DP0/DP1, that points back its source node.
//     3. DP1 does not point to its ARG. It points to the duplication node, which is at 0x02.
//     4. The lambda's body does not point to the dup node, but to the operator. Dup nodes float.
//     5. 0x7b93e8d2b9ba31fb21 is a globally unique random label assigned to the duplication node.
//     6. That duplication label is stored on the DP0/DP1 that point to the node, not on the node.
//     7. A lambda uses 2 memory slots, a duplication uses 3, an operator uses 2. Total: 112 bytes.
//     8. In-memory size is different to, and larger than, serialization size.
//
// How is Kindelia's HVM different from the conventional HVM?
// ----------------------------------------------------------
//
// First, it is a 128-bit, rather than a 64-bit architecture. It can store 120-bit unboxed
// integers, up from 32-bit unboxed uints stored by the conventional HVM. It allows addressing up
// to 2^72 function names, up from 2^30 allowed by the conventional HVM, which isn't enough for
// Kindelia. This change comes with a cost of about ~30% reduced performance, which is acceptable.
//
// Second, it implements a reversible heap machinery, which allows saving periodic snapshots of
// past heap states, and jump back to them. This is necessary because of decentralized consensus.
// If we couldn't revert to past states, we'd have to recompute the entire history anytime there is
// a block reorg, which isn't practical. On Ethereum, this is achieved by storing the state as a
// Map<U256> using Merkle Trees, which, being an immutable structure, allows non-destructive
// insertions and rollbacks. We could do the same, but we decided to further leverage the HVM by
// saving its whole heap as the network state. In other words, applications are allowed to persist
// arbitrary HVM structures on disk by using the io_save operation. For example:
//
//   (io_save {Cons #1 {Cons #2 {Cons #3 {Nil}}}} ...)
//
// The operation above would persist the [1,2,3] list as the app's state, with no need for
// serialization. As such, when the app stops running, that list will not be freed from memory.
// Instead, the heap will persist between blocks, so the app just needs to store a pointer to
// the list's head, allowing it to retrieve its state later on. This is only possible because the
// HVM is garbage-collection free, otherwise, leaks would overwhelm the memory.
//
// How are reversible heaps stored?
// --------------------------------
//
// Kindelia's heap is set to grow exactly 8 GB per year. In other words, 10 years after the genesis
// block, the heap size will be of exactly 80 GB. But that doesn't mean a full node will be able
// to operate with even that much ram, because Kindelia must also save snapshots. Right now, it
// stores at most 10 snapshots, trying to keep them distributed with exponentially decreasing ages.
// For example, if we're on block 1000, it might store a snapshot of blocks 998, 996, 992, 984,
// 968, 872, 744 and 488, which is compatible with the fact that longer-term rollbacks are
// increasingly unlikely. If there is a rollback to block 990, we just go back to the earliest
// snapshot, 984, and reprocess blocks 985-1000, which is much faster than recomputing the entire
// history.
//
// In order to keep a good set of snapshots, we must be able to create and discard these heaps.
// Obviously, if this operation required copying the entire heap buffer every block, it would
// completely destroy the network's performance. As such, instead, heaps only actually store
// data that changed. So, using the example above, if a list was allocated and persisted on block 980,
// it will actually be stored on the snapshot 984, which is the earliest snapshot after 980. If the
// runtime, now on block 1000, attempts to read the memory where the list is allocated, it will
// actually receive a signal that it is stored on a past heap, and look for it on 996 and 992,
// until it is found on block 984.
//
// To achieve that, hashmaps are used to store defined functions and persistent state pointers. If
// a key isn't present, Kindelia will look for it on past snapshots. As for the runtime's memory,
// where HVM constructors and lambdas are stored, it doesn't use a hashmap. Instead, it uses a
// Nodes type, which stores data in a big pre-allocated u128 buffer, and keeps track of used memory
// slots in a separate buffer. We then reserve a constant, U128_NONE, to signal that an index isn't
// present, and must be found ina  past heap. This is different from 0, which means that this index
// is empty, and can be allocated. This allows for fast write, read, disposal and merging of heaps,
// but comes at the cost of wasting a lot of memory. Because of that, Kindelia's current
// implementation demands up to ~10x more available memory than the current heap size, but that
// could be reduced ten-fold by replacing vectors by a hashmap, or by just saving fewer past heaps.
//
// Other than a 128-bit architecture and reversible heaps, Kindelia's HVM is similar to the
// conventional HVM. This file will be extensively commented, with in-depth explanations of every
// little aspect, from the HVM's memory model to interaction net rewrite rules.
